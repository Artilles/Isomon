# Isomon

This was the game my team made for our 2nd term project for the BTech program at BCIT.

I personally worked on sound, UI, text, tilemap and engine architecture.

It is incomplete, without textures or proper shaders, but all of the game logic is in place.

Made in C++ with OpenGL and GLFW. Used OpenAL for the sound and FreeType for text. PC only.
